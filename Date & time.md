# 🕒 Date & Time Display Program (C++)

## Project Description
This **C++ program** displays the **current date and time** in a human-readable format using the `<ctime>` library.  
The program prints:
- Day of the month
- Month name
- Year
- Day of the week
- Time in **12-hour format** with AM/PM

It provides a simple way to understand **time manipulation** and formatting in C++.

---

## Objectives
- Display the current system date and time  
- Format time in 12-hour format with AM/PM  
- Show day of the week and month names  
- Gain practical experience with `<ctime>` library  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** GCC / CodeBlocks / Visual Studio  
- **Library Used:** `<ctime>`  

---

## Program Structure

- Use `time_t` and `localtime()` to get current system time  
- Use arrays to map numeric month/day values to strings  
- Format and display the date and time in a readable format  

---

## Features
- Displays current date: day, month, year  
- Displays day of the week  
- Displays current time in 12-hour format with AM/PM  
- Uses arrays for month and day names for readability  
- Fully console-based and interactive  

---

## Limitations
- Console-based only, no GUI  
- No user input; strictly system time  
- Limited formatting customization  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add user-selectable date/time formats  
- Implement countdown or timer features  
- Allow time zone selection  
- Display both 12-hour and 24-hour formats simultaneously  
- Add alarms or reminders  

---
## Program Workflow
1. Retrieve system time using `time()`  
2. Convert it to local time using `localtime()`  
3. Map numeric month and weekday values to string arrays  
4. Format time in 12-hour format with AM/PM  
5. Display date, day, and time to the console  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of system time in C++  
- Hands-on experience with `<ctime>` library functions  
- Experience in time formatting and string mapping  
- Improved console-based program logic  
- Knowledge of working with arrays and pointers
